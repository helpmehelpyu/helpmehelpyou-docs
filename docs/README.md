# HelpMeHelpYou

This is the documentation for the [HelpMeHelpYou](https://github.com/helpmehelpyu/helpmehelpyou) project.

## What is it

HelpMeHelpYou is a web application that strives to help those with certain skills find those who need their skills more easily.

## Our Mission

This website's main focus to start will be to help people find those with artistic talent, and to help artists find work more easily. This goal may evolve in the future to be more general, i.e. anyone can advertise their skills and find opportunity. Think Amazon but for skills and services rather than products.
