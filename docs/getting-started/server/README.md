# Getting Started with the Server

First navigate to the [server folder](https://github.com/helpmehelpyu/helpmehelpyou/tree/main/server) with your terminal of choice.

## Install

In order to install dependencies, simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

To build the server run:

```bash
npm run build
```

---

#### **NOTE: Make sure to build before you try to start the server for the first time**

---

## Start Server for Production

To Start the server for Production, i.e. no hot reloading

```bash
npm run start
```

## Start Server for Development (hot reloading)

To start the server for Development just run

```
npm run dev
```

whenever you save your work, the server should update to reflect your new changes. Some changes require the server to be restarted manually. That is, kill the server with `Ctrl-C`, then restart again.
