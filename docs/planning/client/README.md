# Website UI Design

## What does my website need to do?

For now:

- Create New User
- Create New Link
- Upload Media
- Delete Links
- Delete Users
- Delete Media
- Allow users to search for artists
- Allow users to seach by skills, what they want (how?)
- Allow users to view work samples from artists
- A Home page to display artwork from users (how?)
- Allow users to contact artists to setup a commision
  - build in chat feature?
- Allow users to leave ratings on artists after they consume their services
- A recommendation algorithm (how?)
  - How to group similar artists together? (graphs?)
  - How to classic art style?

## What will the pages be?

- Home Page
  - will display art from various users (how?)
- Upload Media Page
- Media/Work Sample display/viewing page
- User registration page
- Login Page
- User profile
  - should be able to customize (how?)
  - should be able to display desired/pinned media
  - shows contact information
  - in the future will allow user and potential clients to chat
- User settings page
  - allows users to update their settings
  - allows users to update their profile
  - allows users to add other links
  - allows users to delete their account
- Redirect page
  - to notify the user they are leaving the website and potentially into a unsafe website
- Do I need a landing page? (Let's do it)

## What Might the User Workflow Look Like?

- Home Page -> Media Page -> User Profile -> Contact User
- Home Page -> User Profile -> Contact User
- Home Page -> User Settings -> Save Settings -> User Profile
- Home Page -> Logout -> Home Page
- Home Page -> Login Page -> Home Page
- Home Page -> Login Page -> Register Page -> Home Page
- Media Page -> Home Page -> Another Media Page
- Media Page -> Delete Media (button shown only if author)
- Landing Page -> Home Page
- Landing Page -> Register Page / Login Page
- User Profile -> Click Link -> Redirect Page -> Link Source
